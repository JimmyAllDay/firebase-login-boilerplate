# Firebase Authentication Boilerplate

This repo is a boilerplate for a react client that uses Firebase Authentication.

Its intention is to provide a means to quickly prototype apps that require a basic authentication flow.

It's built using React, React-bootstrap, and of course, Firebase. Tested using Jest and React Testing Library.
